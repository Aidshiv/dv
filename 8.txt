Program 8: Dashboards and Filters in Power BI


Step 1: Introduction to Filters
Filters help refine the data to focus on specific subsets. There are four primary types of filters in Power BI:

Visual Filters: Apply to a single visual on the report page.
Page Filters: Apply to all visuals on a specific report page.
Report Filters: Apply to all pages in the report.
Drillthrough Filters: Allow users to drill down to a specific report page for a focused view.


Step 2: Applying Filters
Using the HR dataset from Program 7, we will extend the dashboard with filters.

1. Visual Filter:
Drag the Department field to the Filters pane under Filters on this Visual.
Choose a specific department, e.g., "HR."
The selected visual now only displays data for the HR department.
2. Page Filter:
Drag the Department field to Filters on this Page.
Select multiple departments, e.g., "HR" and "R&D."
All visuals on the page now display data for these departments.



3. Advanced Filter:
Drag Monthly Income to the Filters pane.
Select the filter type as Advanced Filtering.
Configure to show items where the value is greater than or equal to 10000.


4. Top N Filter:
Apply to a visual showing Job Roles.
Set the filter type to Top N.
Display the Top 4 Job Roles by Sum of Job Satisfaction.


Step 3: Formatting the Dashboard
Use the Format Your Visual pane to customize titles, colors, labels, and borders.
Standardize visual styles with the Format Painter to apply consistent formatting across visuals.
Adjust slicer settings to improve usability and aesthetics.
