Program 7: Creating Reports & Visualizations in Power BI
Step 1: Open Power BI Desktop
Launch Power BI Desktop and open a blank report.


Step 2: Load Dataset
Click on Get Data in the ribbon pane.
Select Excel Workbook or CSV file.
Choose the specific dataset (e.g., HR Data.csv) and click Open.
Click on Transform Data to clean and preprocess the data.


Step 3: Transform Data in Power Query Editor
Perform necessary transformations to prepare the dataset:
Using First Row as Header
Select Use First Row as Header from the ribbon.
Creating a New Column
Select the column for which a new calculation is needed (e.g., Attrition column).
Go to the Add Column tab and configure the formula.
The new column will appear at the end of the table.
Change the datatype of this column to Whole Number.
Apply Transformations
Click Close & Apply to load the transformed data into Power BI Desktop.


Step 4: Create Visualizations
On the Canvas, design visualizations using the data loaded into the Fields Pane.
Creating a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Chart
Select the KPI visualization from the Visualizations Pane.
Drag relevant fields into Indicator and Target goals fields.
Format the KPI:
Go to the Format Your Visual pane.
Under the General tab, set a title, color, and alignment.
Under Effects, toggle Visual Border ON and customize border color and corner rounding.
Customize Callout Value font color under the Visual tab.


Step 5: Common Visualizations
Pie Chart: Use to represent the proportion of categories to a whole.

Drag the required fields for Values and Legend into the chart.
Format titles, labels, and background using the Format Your Visual pane.
Stacked Column Chart:

Select the visualization and add relevant fields for Axis and Values.
Use this chart to display numerical data across categories.
Matrix Visualization:

Drag fields to the Rows, Columns, and Values areas.
Format row and column headers, background color, and totals.
Donut Chart: Similar to a Pie Chart but with a blank center for labels or icons.

Step 6: Add Filters Using Slicers
Select the Slicer visualization from the Visualizations Pane.
Drag a field into the slicer to filter data dynamically.
Customize slicer type (e.g., category, range, or date).
Format slicer appearance for better alignment with the report.


Step 7: Formatting Visualizations
Complete formatting for one visual, then use the Format Painter to apply the same design to others.
Customize each visual as needed:
Set font size, colors, and background.
Use borders and rounded corners for aesthetic appeal.


Step 8: Sort Data
Create an additional column for sorting (if required).
Change the datatype to Whole Number.
In the Fields Pane, select Sort By Column to apply sorting.


Step 9: Save and Share
Save your Power BI report as a .pbix file.
Share the file or publish it to the Power BI Service for broader accessibility.
