Step 3: Build the Dashboard
Combine the above visualizations into a single, cohesive dashboard.
Arrange visuals logically, with filters and slicers for interactivity.
Use themes and consistent formatting to enhance readability.
Final Touches
Save your work as a .pbix file.
Publish the report to the Power BI Service to enable sharing and further interaction.
