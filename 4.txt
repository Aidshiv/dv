Add Sheet 1 for Ontario:
Drag another copy of Sheet 1 and place it between the two existing sheets.
Rename it to "Ontario".
Click on Ontario in the map and then select Update to highlight Ontario on the map.

Click Update.
Add a Textbox:
Drag "Drag to add text" onto the line graph.
Add a key message: “Ontario had the highest health expenditure in Canada in 2016, spending $87,195.70M”.
